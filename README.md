# portfolio

This is my portfolio written with AngularJS. Since I don't often update the content of my portfolio, data is retrieved from a JSON file instead of an API that's synced with a CMS. This allows me to experiment a lot more as I figure out how best to present my work.

## Yeoman

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular). I was hoping Yeoman could fill the hole that Ember-CLI left in my heart.
